",1
" Development of new TB treatments is very long and costly, and hampered by several methodological limitations.",0
The most commonly touted challenge in TB therapeutics remains the absence of a surrogate marker that can be readily measured and that estimates with adequate certainty the anticipated treatment effect in late stage clinical development.,0
"New opportunities are emerging with the recent developments in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics methodologies, novel clinical trial designs, new biomarkers, as well as recent advances in molecular diagnostics.",1
"A recently broadened and exciting pipeline of new candidate drugs compels us to revisit our current approaches to TB drug development, and based on the learnings of the last 50 years, to identify and seek consensus on best practices for future TB clinical trial designs.",1
"GENEVA and Washington, D.C. É?? A new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Solidarity Response Fund will raise money from a wide range of donors to support the work of the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners to help countries respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. ",1

"During its 63rd session, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) accepted all recommendations from the 42nd meeting of the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD). ",1
"This effectively brings twelve psychoactive substances, including eleven New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) and one medicine, under international control.  ",1
"Given the potential for dependence or abuse and known adverse effects, these compounds pose a risk to public health and society and are largely without any therapeutic benefit. ",0
"Based on an in-depth review of candidate compounds by the ECDD, an independent group of experts in the field of drugs and medicines, the WHO provides annual recommendations on substance scheduling to the CND, a policy-making body comprised of 53 UN Member States.",1
"This ECDD review includes a balanced consideration of potential for abuse, dependence and harm with therapeutic value. ",1
The CND then votes on whether or not the WHO recommendations for placing reviewed substances under international control should be endorsed.,1
"A total of 54 human cases of dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease) were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019, with Chad reporting 48 out of the 54 cases",1
"In Chad, Ethiopia, Mali and South Sudan, trained volunteers are supporting surveillance and detection of infections in domestic dogs and cats. Surveillance has been heightened, as evidenced by the increase in reports of rumoured human cases which in 2019 peaked at 108 207 out of which 106 678 were investigated within 24 hours.",1
"É??We are working with the broader scientific community to understand the epidemiology of animal infections, mainly in dogs in Chad, where the highest number of human cases were reported in 2019,É?ù said Dr Dieudonn?? Sankara, who leads WHOÉ??s eradication and elimination team in the Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases.",1
"Interestingly, there have been no human cases in Ethiopia and Mali, and 4 human cases in South Sudan in 2019, compared with 10 in 2018.",1
"Geneva, 23 March 2020: FIFA, the international governing body of football, and the World Health Organization (WHO) have teamed up to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19) by launching a new awareness campaign led by world-renowned footballers, who are calling on all people around the world to follow five key steps to stop the spread of the disease.",1

"GENEVA  As the world comes together to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to ensure that essential health services and operations are continued to protect the lives of people with TB and other diseases or health conditions. ",1
"Health services, including national programmes to combat TB, need to be actively engaged in ensuring an effective and rapid response to COVID-19 while ensuring that TB services are maintained.",1
"In the lead- up to World TB Day, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General emphasized in a news release, É??COVID-19 is highlighting just how vulnerable people with lung diseases and weakened immune systems can be. ",1
The world committed to end TB by 2030; improving prevention is key to making this happen.É?ù,1
"At this unique time in history when the world is grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and STI Programmes stands in solidarity with governments and communities as they seek to maintain health services and continue to address the needs of patients suffering from HIV and tuberculosis (TB). ",1
"Despite being preventable and treatable, tuberculosis remains the worldÉ??s biggest infectious killer and the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLHIV), responsible for 32% of the 770 000 lives lost to HIV in 2018. ",1
People living with HIV are far more vulnerable (nearly 20 times more) to TB infection than people without HIV and are three times more likely to die during TB treatment.,1
"While there are proven interventions that reduce TB deaths É?? such as provision of TB preventive treatment, adoption of novel diagnostics for earlier TB diagnosis and linkage to treatment, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) É?? we are far behind in scaling these up, and diagnostic and treatment gaps remain, with only half of estimated TB cases among PLHIV reaching care in 2018, only half of estimated PLHIV with TB receiving ART, and less than half of PLHIV new on ART initiating TB preventive treatment in a subset of countries which reported globally.",1
Substantial progress has been made during the past decade to prevent and control schistosomiasis (also known as bilharziasis) globally,1
"The disease affects more than 230 million people, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.",1
"Progress is mainly due to large-scale periodic treatment of affected populations with praziquantel, the only medicine recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) against all forms of schistosomiasis",1
"Regular treatment cures mild symptoms and prevents progression to severe, chronic disease. ",0
". É??Through progressive scale-up of periodic large-scale treatment to control morbidity in many endemic countries, we are closer to achieving the minimum target of 75% global coverage of all schoolÉ?êaged children,É?ù said Dr Amadou Garba Djirmay, who leads WHOÉ??s global schistosomiasis control programme. ",1
"É??But if we want to achieve elimination, we must go a step further to introduce snail control in hot spots and in areas targeting elimination. This is bound to increase impact and accelerate progress towards interruption of transmission.É?ù",0
"GENEVA - Prevention and treatment services for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) have been severely disrupted since the COVID-19 pandemic began, according to a WHO survey released today.",1
"The survey, which was completed by 155 countries during a 3-week period in May, confirmed that the impact is global, but that low-income countries are most affected.",1
This situation is of significant concern because people living with NCDs are at higher risk of severe COVID-19-related illness and death.,1
"É??The results of this survey confirm what we have been hearing from countries for a number of weeks now,É?ù said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization.",1
"É??Many people who need treatment for diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes have not been receiving the health services and medicines they need since the COVID-19 pandemic began.",1
"ItÉ??s vital that countries find innovative ways to ensure that essential services for NCDs continue, even as they fight COVID-19.É?ù",1
New guidance from the World Health Organization will help countries keep essential health services running whilst taking measures to keep people safe in the COVID-19 pandemic.,1
"Most health systems are facing challenges of increased demand for care of people with COVID-19, compounded by fear, misinformation and limitations on movement that disrupt the delivery of health care for all conditions.",1
"Countries must find ways to keep people safe and ensure the delivery of services such as emergency care for conditions like heart attacks and injury; immunization to prevent outbreaks; treatment for infectious diseases like HIV, malaria and tuberculosis; and screening and treatment for noncommunicable diseases like cancer and diabetes.",0
"With COVID-19 science now doubling every 20 days and new guidance being published daily by WHO, health workers face the challenge of keeping up with constantly evolving information related to this disease.",1

"As of 13 June, 41 symptomatic laboratory confirmed cases and 46 laboratory confirmed cases without symptoms of COVID-19 have been identified in Beijing.",1
"The first identified case had symptom onset on 9 June, and was confirmed on 11 June.",1
Several of the initial cases were identified through six fever clinics in Beijing.,1
Preliminary investigations revealed that some of the initial symptomatic cases had a link to the Xinfadi Market in Beijing.,1
Preliminary laboratory investigations of throat swabs from humans and environmental samples from Xinfadi Market identified 45 positive human samples (all without symptoms at the time of reporting) and 40 positive environmental samples.,1
One additional case without symptoms was identified as a close contact of a confirmed case.,1
"All cases are in isolation and under care as needed, and contact tracing is underway.",0
Genetic sequencing of samples is also underway and rapid sharing of these results is important to understand the origin of the cluster and links between cases.,0

"He reminded parlamentarians, that É??although the situation in Europe has improved, globally it is still getting worseÉ?ù and he added that É??In the first month of this outbreak, less than 10,000 cases were reported to WHO.",1
"In the last month, almost 4 million cases have been reported.É?ù",1
"The pandemic is showing how essential it is for governments at all levels, including local governments, to strengthen their capacity for prevention, preparedness and response.",1
"But plans for the post-COVID-19 recovery, and to reduce the risk of future epidemics, must go further upstream than early detection and control of disease outbreaks É?? É??they must also lessen our impact on the environment, to reduce risk at the sourceÉ?ù, Dr Tedros stressed.",1
WHO today accepted the recommendation from the Solidarity TrialÉ??s International Steering Committee to discontinue the trialÉ??s hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir arms.,1
The Solidarity Trial was established by WHO to find an effective COVID-19 treatment for hospitalized patients.,1
"The International Steering Committee formulated the recommendation in light of the evidence for hydroxychloroquine vs standard-of-care and for lopinavir/ritonavir vs standard-of-care from the Solidarity trial interim results, and from a review of the evidence from all trials",0
These interim trial results show that hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir produce little or no reduction in the mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to standard of care.,1
Solidarity trial investigators will interrupt the trials with immediate effect.,0
"For each of the drugs, the interim results do not provide solid evidence of increased mortality.",0
"There were, however, some associated safety signals in the clinical laboratory findings of the add-on Discovery trial, a participant in the Solidarity trial.",0
These will also be reported in the peer-reviewed publication.,0
This decision applies only to the conduct of the Solidarity trial in hospitalized patients and does not affect the possible evaluation in other studies of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir in non-hospitalized patients or as pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19.,1
The interim Solidarity results are now being readied for peer-reviewed publication.,0
WHO experts will travel to China to work together with their Chinese counterparts to prepare scientific plans for identifying the zoonotic source of the SARS-COV-2 virus.,1

"É??The magnitude of this pandemic, which has touched virtually everyone in the world, clearly deserves a commensurate evaluation.É?ù",1
Dr Tedros proposed that a Special Session of the Executive Board be called in September to discuss the PanelÉ??s progress.,1
In November the Panel will present an interim report at the resumption of the World Health Assembly.,0
"In January 2021, the Executive Board will hold its regular session, where the PanelÉ??s work will be further discussed; and in May of next year, at the World Health Assembly, the panel will present its substantive report.",1
The Director-General noted that the Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee for the WHO Health Emergencies Programme will also continue its existing work.,1
"É??Even as we fight this pandemic, we must be readying ourselves for future global outbreaks and the many other challenges of our time such as antimicrobial resistance, inequality and the climate crisis,É?ù said Dr Tedros.",1
É??COVID-19 has taken so much from us. But it is also giving us an opportunity to break with the past and build back better.É?ù,1
The World Health Organization and UNICEF warned today of an alarming decline in the number of children receiving life-saving vaccines around the world.,1
This is due to disruptions in the delivery and uptake of immunization services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.,1
"According to new data by WHO and UNICEF, these disruptions threaten to reverse hard-won progress to reach more children and adolescents with a wider range of vaccines, which has already been hampered by a decade of stalling coverage.",1
The latest data on vaccine coverage estimates from WHO and UNICEF for 2019 shows that improvements such as the expansion of the HPV vaccine to 106 countries and greater protection for children against more diseases are in danger of lapsing.,1
"For example, preliminary data for the first four months of 2020 points to a substantial drop in the number of children completing three doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3).",0
This is the first time in 28 years that the world could see a reduction in DTP3 coverage É?? the marker for immunization coverage within and across countries.,1
"Seventy-five countries have submitted expressions of interest to protect their populations and those of other nations through joining the COVAX Facility, a mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.",1
"The 75 countries, which would finance the vaccines from their own public finance budgets, partner with up to 90 lower-income countries that could be supported through voluntary donations to GaviÉ??s COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC).",1
"). Together, this group of up to 165 countries represents more than 60% of the worldÉ??s population. Among the group are representatives from every continent and more than half of the worldÉ??s G20 economies.",1
"É??COVAX is the only truly global solution to the COVID-19 pandemic,É?ù said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.",1
"For the vast majority of countries, whether they can afford to pay for their require assistance, it means receiving a guaranteed share of avoiding being pushed to the back of the queue",0
"Even for those countries that are able to secure their own agreements with vaccine manufacturers, this mechanism represents, through its world-leading portfolio of vaccine candidates, a means of reducing the risks associated with individual candidates failing to show efficacy or gain licensure.",1
"World Health Organization Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus today joined the leadership of Spain, paying homage to those who have lost their lives in the country due to COVID-19, saluting the heroic efforts of heath workers and praising the governmentÉ??s resolute and robust response to reverse the virusÉ??s transmission.",1
"É??It is with great respect that I join the King of Spain, the Prime Minister and the entire government of the country to pay tribute to the people who have fallen victim to COVID-19,É?ù said Dr Tedros.",1
"É??I extend my deepest condolences to the families of all people who have lost their lives due to this virus in Spain, and around the world.É?ù",1
"At one point, Spain was among the countries impacted most by COVID-19. At the outbreakÉ??s peak, close to 10 000 new cases were reported in a single day in Spain.",1
"Since then, intensive efforts, led by robust surveillance, testing, contact tracing, treatment and isolation, have managed to suppress transmission.",1
"Dr Tedros said this shift was due to the leadership shown by Spain and the strong resolve shown by the Spanish public to adhere to strict restrictions, including lockdowns, physical distancing and other critical measures to contain transmission.",1
"These efforts, combined, have successfully changed the course of the countryÉ??s outbreak.",0
"É??Spain has shown that with political leadership and action, backed by community support, that COVID-19 can be controlled, no matter at what stage virus transmission is at in a country.",1
"From being greatly challenged, Spain has reversed the trajectory of the outbreak,É?ù Dr Tedros added.",1
"É??While we have witnessed the suppression of the virus across Spain, I support the commitment by Spanish authorities to remain vigilant in the face of the persistent threat that COVID-19 poses.É?ù",1
"The Emergency Committee on COVID-19, convened by the WHO Director-General under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR), held its fourth meeting on 31 July.",1
"In its statement following the meeting, published today, it expressed É??appreciation for WHO and partnersÉ?? COVID-19 pandemic response efforts, and highlighted the anticipated lengthy duration of this COVID-19 pandemic, noting the importance of sustained community, national, regional, and global response efforts.É?ù",1
"After a full discussion and review of the evidence, the Committee unanimously agreed that the outbreak still constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and offered this advice to Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.",1
Dr Tedros accepted the advice of the Committee and confirmed that the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to constitute a PHEIC.,1
The Director-General declared a PHEICÉ??WHOÉ??s highest level of alarm under IHRÉ??on 30 January at a time when there were fewer than 100 cases and no deaths outside China.,1
He issued the CommitteeÉ??s advice to States Parties as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR.,1

"As schools worldwide struggle with reopening, the latest data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) reveal that 43 per cent of schools around the world lacked access to basic handwashing with soap and water in 2019 É?? a key condition for schools to be able to operate safely in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.",1
"É??Global school closures since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have presented an unprecedented challenge to childrenÉ??s education and wellbeing,É?ù said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director.",1
É??We must prioritize childrenÉ??s learning.,0
"This means making sure that schools are safe to reopen É?? including with access to hand hygiene, clean drinking water and safe sanitation.É?ù",0
"According to the report, around 818 million children lack basic handwashing facilities at their schools, which puts them at increased risk of COVID-19 and other transmittable diseases.",1
More than one third of these children (295 million) are from sub-Saharan Africa.,0
"In the least developed countries, 7 out of 10 schools lack basic handwashing facilities and half of schools lack basic sanitation and water services.",1
The report stresses that governments seeking to control the spread of COVID-19 must balance the need for implementation of public health measures versus the associated social and economic impacts of lockdown measures.,1
"Evidence of the negative impacts of prolonged school closures on childrenÉ??s safety, wellbeing and learning are well-documented, the report says.",0
"The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) call on governments to ensure that the procurement and supply of controlled medicines in countries meet the needs of patients, both those who have COVID-19 and those who require internationally controlled medicines for other medical conditions.",1
There is a need to ensure access to controlled medicines such as sedatives and analgesics for intubation protocols for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.,1
"Non-COVID patients continue to require controlled medicines for the management of pain and palliative care, surgical care and anaesthesia, mental health and neurological conditions, and for the treatment of drug use disorders.",1
It is important to remember the needs of existing patients who require controlled medicines for the management of these health conditions.,0
These patients faced barriers to accessing controlled medicines before the COVID-19 pandemic.,1
"The COVID-19 pandemic has further resulted in interruptions of the medicines supply chain, and it is critical that access to essential health services and medications not be forgotten or de-prioritised during this pandemic.",1
"On 14 August Korean Ambassador, Ms Ji-ah Paik and WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with WHO in support of the OrganizationÉ??s COVID-19 response efforts in the African region.",1
"The new MoU follows a recent call between Dr Tedros and Mr Moon Jae-in, President of the Republic of Korea, during which WHO Director-General expressed the need for additional support to scale up the COVID-19 response in the African region.",1
The MoU sets out an in-kind contribution of US$ 6 million in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests / extraction kits to be delivered to 24 countries in Africa in the coming months.,1
"PCR has proven to be a critically important laboratory tool, providing results that are reliable and consistent.",1
"É??WHO is deeply grateful for this support, which is helping to increase the testing capacity in Africa,É?ù said Dr Tedros.",1
É??This tremendous show of support is also strengthening the relationship between WHO and the Republic of Korea.,1
The Republic of Korea is an important partner in global health.É?ù,1
The support of the Republic of Korea follows the successful management of COVID-19 in the country and is now providing support to other countries.,1
"The Republic of Korea has a strong background in fighting infectious diseases, including the MERS CoV outbreak in 2015 and the recent outbreak of COVID-19.",1
"Leveraging this experience and demonstrating leadership, it has recently launched the Global Support Group for Infectious Disease Response (G4IDR) in Geneva.",1
Global health security and emergency response operations have long been a priority for the Republic of Korea.,1
"Dr JW Lee, WHO Director-General from 2003 to 2006, understood the critical need for international cooperation during public health emergencies, for trust, transparency and information sharing among all stakeholders in the global community.",1
"The first emergency operations centre, the Strategic Health Operations Centre (SHOC), was established thanks to the vision of Dr Lee.",1
"Today the SHOC is the hub of the Emergency Public Health Operations Centres Network, with more than 140 member institutions in over 80 countries around the world.",1
"172 economies are now engaged in discussions to potentially participate in COVAX, a global initiative aimed at working with vaccine manufacturers to provide countries worldwide equitable access to safe and effective vaccines, once they are licensed and approved.",1
"COVAX currently has the worldÉ??s largest and most diverse COVID-19 vaccine portfolio - including nine candidate vaccines, with a further nine under evaluation and conversations underway with other mayor producers.",1
"COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the World Health Organization (WHO) É?? working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers.",1
It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.,1
"In order to be able to secure enough doses of vaccines to protect the most vulnerable populations, such as health workers and the elderly, the next step for the partnership is to confirm potential self-financing participantsÉ?? intent to participate by 31 August and to turn these into binding commitments to join the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX Facility) by 18 September, with first upfront payments to follow thereafter, and no later than 9 October 2020.",1
"É??Equal access to a COVID-19 vaccine is the key to beating the virus and paving the way for recovery from the pandemic,É?ù said Stefan L??fven, Prime Minister of Sweden.",1
"É??This cannot be a race with a few winners, and the COVAX Facility is an important part of the solution É?? making sure all countries can benefit from access to the worldÉ??s largest portfolio of candidates and fair and equitable distribution of vaccine doses.É?ù",1
Mental health is one of the most neglected areas of public health.,1
"Close to 1 billion people are living with a mental disorder, 3 million people die every year from the harmful use of alcohol and one person dies every 40 seconds by suicide.",1
"And now, billions of people around the world have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is having a further impact on peopleÉ??s mental health.",1
"Yet, relatively few people around the world have access to quality services.",0
"In low- and middle-income countries, more than 75% of people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders receive no treatment for their condition at all. Furthermore, stigma, discrimination, punitive legislation and human rights abuses are still widespread.",1
"The limited access to quality, affordable mental health care in the world before the pandemic, and particularly in humanitarian emergencies and conflict settings, has been further diminished due to COVID-19 as the pandemic has disrupted health services around the world.",1
Primary causes have been infection and the risk of infection in long-stay facilities such as care homes and psychiatric institutions; barriers to meeting people face-to-face.,0
The World Health Organization (WHO) today published a first indicative survey on the impact of COVID-19 on health systems based on 105 countriesÉ?? reports.,1
"Data collected from five regions over the period from March to June 2020 illustrate that almost every country (90%) experienced disruption to its health services, with low- and middle-income countries reporting the greatest difficulties.",1
"Most countries reported that many routine and elective services have been suspended, while critical care - such as cancer screening and treatment and HIV therapy É?? has seen high-risk interruptions in low-income countries.",1
"The survey shines a light on the cracks in our health systems, but it also serves to inform new strategies to improve healthcare provision during the pandemic and beyond,É?ù said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.",1
COVID-19 should be a lesson to all countries that health is not an É??either-orÉ?? equation.,1
We must better prepare for emergencies but also keep investing in health systems that fully respond to peopleÉ??s needs throughout the life course.,0
"""Services hit across the board: Based on reports from key informants, countries on average experienced disruptions in 50% of a set of 25 tracer services.",1

"Countries also reported disruptions in malaria diagnosis and treatment (46%), tuberculosis case detection and treatment (42%) and antiretroviral treatment (32%).",1
"While some areas of health care, such as dental care and rehabilitation, may have been deliberately suspended in line with government protocols, the disruption of many of the other services is expected to have harmful effects on population health in the short- medium- and long-term.",0
Potentially life-saving emergency services were disrupted in almost a quarter of responding countries.,0
"Disruptions to 24-hour emergency room services for example were affected in 22% of countries, urgent blood transfusions were disrupted in 23% of countries, emergency surgery was affected in 19% of the countries.",1

"At its peak, in the second week of September, India had 10.17 lakh active cases, with more than 90,000 infections being detected every day.",1
"There has been a remarkable turnaround after that, with active cases going down steadily and progressively for the last two months.",0
"On Tuesday, the active cases fell to 4.94 lakh.",1
"As many as 48,493 people recuperated from COVID-19 in a day bringing IndiaÉ??s active caseload below 5% of the total infections as daily recoveries remained higher than single-day rise in cases for the last 47 days, according to data updated by the Union Health Ministry on Thursday.",1

The World Health Organization (WHO) is calling on governments and health care leaders to address persistent threats to the health and safety of health workers and patients.,1
The pandemic has also highlighted the extent to which protecting health workers is key to ensuring a functioning health system and a functioning society.,0
"While health workers represent less than 3% of the population in the large majority of countries and less than 2% in almost all low- and middle-income countries, around 14% of COVID-19 cases reported to WHO are among health workers.",1
"In some countries, the proportion can be as high as 35%. However, data availability and quality are limited, and it is not possible to establish whether health workers were infected in the work place or in community settings.",0

"The vaccine developed by the University of Oxford, UK, and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca was found to be, on average, 70% effective in a preliminary analysis of phase III trial data, the developers announced in a press release on 23 November.",1
But the analysis found a striking difference in efficacy depending on the amount of vaccine delivered to a participant.,0
A regimen consisting of 2 full doses given a month apart seemed to be just 62% effective.,1
"But, surprisingly, participants who received a lower amount of the vaccine in the first dose and then the full amount in the second dose were 90% less likely to develop COVID-19 than were participants in the placebo arm.",1

"More reliable, age-disaggregated data on infection, deaths and testing is needed to better understand how the crisis impacts the most vulnerable children and guide the response.",0
"While children can transmit the virus to each other and to older age groups, there is strong evidence that, with basic safety measures in place, the net benefits of keeping schools open outweigh the costs of closing them, the report notes.",0
"Schools are not a main driver of community transmission, and children are more likely to get the virus outside of school settings.",1

"Globally in the past week, over 4 million new cases were reported.",1

"This variant also ""appears to affect more adults under age 20,"" Carnethon told MSNBC.",1
And I think the reason why that's particularly critical is that this younger adult population is circulating more.,0

"According to data from the COVID Tracking Project, more than 65,000 confirmed and probable virus-related US deaths have been reported during the month.",1

"There are currently 118,720 COVID-19 patients in US hospitals.",1
"Globally, 4.1 million new cases were reported in the past week, a decline of 15% from the previous week and the second week of decline after global case incidence peaked in the first week of January 2021 (Figure 1)",1
"This downward trend is largely attributed to relative reductions in case incidence in several countries that have contributed the highest numbers in recent months, but hides continued upward trends in other countries in the same regions",0
The ongoing and prolonged high rates of new infections continues to strain health systems in many countries around the world,0
All regions reported a decline in new cases except the Western Pacific Region which reported a similar incidence to last week (Table 1),1

"Or should we aim higher and attempt to eliminate the disease, meaning there would be no new cases of that disease within our borders?",1
"A third scenario is eradicationÉ??achieving zero new cases worldwideÉ??but this would be an enormous and highly uncertain global undertaking (weÉ??ve only eradicated one human infectious disease, smallpox).",0
"A public service ad campaign unveiled Thursday aims to convince Americans to get vaccinated against COVID-19, telling them É??It's Up to You.É?ù",1

CDC continues to learn more about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 pandemic,1
Information in past Science Briefs might not reflect CDCÉ??s current understanding and recommendations,1
CDCÉ??s Science Briefs summarize the scientific evidence behind specific guidance and recommendations,1
Each Science Brief captures the scientific evidence and our understanding of it at the time the brief was published,0
The principal mode by which people are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is through exposure to respiratory droplets carrying infectious virus,1
"It is possible for people to be infected through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects (fomites), but the risk is generally considered to be low",0
"The pandemic of this century has overwhelmed the healthcare systems of affected countries, and all resources have been diverted to coronavirus disease 2019",1
"At the onset, coronavirus disease 2019 can present as any other acute febrile undifferentiated illness",0
"In tropical regions, clinicians are increasingly challenged to differentiate these febrile illnesses without the use of diagnostics",0
"With this pandemic, many of these tropical diseases are neglected and go underreported",0
"Dengue is holoendemic in the Maldives, and dengue viruses circulate throughout the year",1
"Reports about coinfections with dengue virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 are scarce, and the outcome and the dynamics of the disease may be altered in the presence of coinfection",1
"We have described the clinical manifestation and serial laboratory profile, and highlighted the atypical findings uncommon in dengue infection",0
"After genome sequencing of over 10,000 COVID-19 cases in India, researchers have discovered a new variant with two new mutations which may be better at evading the immune system",1
"In 15-20 per cent of samples from the Indian state of Maharashtra (the state accounting for 62 per cent of cases in the country) a new, double mutation in key areas of the virus has been detected",1
These are now known as the E484Q and L452R mutations,1
"Given what we have seen with other similar mutations, it might also make it harder for our immune system to recognise the virus due to its slightly different shape",1
This means our immune system may not be able to recognise the virus as something it has to produce antibodies against,0
"For the first time, more than 2,000 COVID-19 deaths were registered in a single day in India (without considering backlogs) on Tuesday (April 20)",1
"As many as 2,007 deaths and 2,93,534 cases were recorded in the country",1
"Maharashtra reported 62,097 infections (accounting for nearly 22% of the new cases) on Tuesday, followed by Uttar Pradesh with 29,574 new infections and Delhi with 28,395 new cases",1
"As many as 15,19,486 samples were tested on Monday (results of which were made available on Tuesday)",1
This was only the second instance when the number of daily tests crossed the 15-lakh-mark,1
66 lakh tests were conducted on April 17,1
The new coronavirus has changed life as we know it,0

The volume of online job postings dropped significantly since the start of the pandemic and the introduction of COVID-19 related containment measures,1
"In the second half of March 2020, job vacancies advertised on line in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States declined sharply and by early May, the volume of online job vacancies had fallen by over 50% in all five countries compared to the beginning of the year",1
"Data show that the drop was widespread, affecting almost all sectors and occupations in the five economies",0
"By the end of December, the drop in online job postings was still very evident in the United States and the United Kingdom",1
"The COVID-19 pandemic is a disaster that combines a biological threat with various vulnerabilities, such as the organizational and response capacity of health systems, overcrowding, informality, social work practices, and public transport",1
The human and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are unprecedented,0
"According to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, by November 2020 it had caused more than 18 times more deaths than all the epidemics that took place in Latin America and the Caribbean between 1970 and 2019",1
"For the first time since records began, all the countries of the region have seen their economies contract at the same time, destroying jobs and driving up poverty and inequality",0
"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the cracks in the existing development pattern, and revealed its limitations, around the world, but particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean",1
"The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), in collaboration with Canadian public health experts, has updated this guidance on the use of non-pharmaceutical public health measures (PHM) to mitigate community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)",1
The primary audiences for the guidance are federal/provincial/territorial (FPT) and regional/local public health authorities (PHA),1
"In the operationalization of this guidance, it is recognized that each PHA may have unique approaches to implement individual and community-based measures, based on jurisdiction-specific considerations",1
Principles and concepts outlined in The Canadian pandemic influenza preparedness: Planning guidance for the health sector were used as a foundation in the development of this guidance,1
An EU entry ban is in effect for people from countries outside the European Union/Schengen area,1
"There are exemptions to the entry ban, for example for people travelling from a safe country or people with proof of vaccination or proof of recovery",0
This proof of vaccination or recovery must meet certain requirements,0
From 23 March 2022 people travelling to the Netherlands no longer need to show a negative test result,1
The rapid spread of the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has sparked alarm worldwide,1
"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the condition a global pandemic, with many countries grappling with the rise of infections",1
"The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in China in December 2019",1
"From there, it has spread to over 192 countries and territories",1
"The pathogen is a coronavirus, a type of virus that typically causes respiratory illness",1
"Coronavirus: a type of common virus that infects humans, typically leading to an upper respiratory infection (URI)",1
Seven different types of human coronavirus have been identified,0
Most people will be infected with at least one type of coronavirus in their lifetime,0
"The viruses are spread through the air by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, touching an object or surface contaminated with the virus and rarely, by fecal contamination",1
"The illness caused by most coronaviruses usually lasts a short time and is characterized by runny nose, sore throat, feeling unwell, cough, and fever",0
COVID-19 is the most significant global crisis of any of our lifetimes,1
"The numbers have been stupefying, whether of infection and mortality, the scale of public health measures, or the economic consequences of shutdown",0
Coronavirus Politics identifies key threads in the global comparative discussion that continue to shed light on COVID-19 and shape debates about what it means for scholarship in health and comparative politics,1
"King, Elize Massard da Fonseca, and Andr?? Peralta-Santos bring together over 30 authors versed in politics and the health issues in order to understand the health policy decisions, the public health interventions, the social policy decisions, their interactions, and the reasons",1
"The book's coverage is global, with a wide range of key and exemplary countries, and contains a mixture of comparative, thematic, and templated country studies",0
"January 30, 2021, marked the first anniversary of the declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) of COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)",1
"Thus far, the world has been no match for SARS-CoV-2, with more than 100 million cases and 2.5 million deaths",1
"The US has been among the worldÉ??s poorest performers in addressing the pandemic, with more than 500 000 deaths",1
"Vaccines offer the best chance of returning to normal, but circulating variants pose a major obstacle, particularly the emergence of variants that are more transmissible and are developing partial resistance to vaccines against SARS-CoV-2",1
"With rampant global circulation, SARS-CoV-2 will have ample opportunity to mutate further",1
"An international team of scientists has found evidence that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, infects cells in the mouth",1
"While itÉ??s well known that the upper airways and lungs are primary sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there are clues the virus can infect cells in other parts of the body, such as the digestive system, blood vessels, kidneys and, as this new study shows, the mouth",1
"The potential of the virus to infect multiple areas of the body might help explain the wide-ranging symptoms experienced by COVID-19 patients, including oral symptoms such as taste loss, dry mouth and blistering",1
"Moreover, the findings point to the possibility that the mouth plays a role in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to the lungs or digestive system via saliva laden with virus from infected oral cells",1
A better understanding of the mouthÉ??s involvement could inform strategies to reduce viral transmission within and outside the body,0
The team was led by researchers at the National Institutes of Health and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,1
"Twenty-three patients presented with mucormycosis, all had an association with coronavirus disease 2019",1
The ethmoids (100 per cent) were the most common sinuses affected,0
"Intra-orbital extension was seen in 43.47 per cent of cases, while intracranial extension was only seen in 8.69 percent",1
"Diabetes mellitus was present in 21 of 23 cases, and was uncontrolled in 12 cases",1
All patients had a history of steroid use during their coronavirus treatment,0
The national emergency caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the United States continues to pose a grave threat to our health and security,1
"As of April 29, 2021, the United States had experienced more than 32 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 570,000 COVID-19 deaths",1
"It is the policy of my Administration to implement science-based public health measures, across all areas of the Federal Government, to act swiftly and aggressively to prevent further spread of the disease",0
Americans could agree on a few things at that early stage of the Virus,0
"With restaurants, stores and other public spaces around the country closing their doors, most saw COVID-19 as a serious economic threat to the nation",1
Most approved of their state and local officialsÉ?? initial responses to the outbreak,0
And they generally had confidence in hospitals and medical centers to handle the needs of those stricken with the virus,0
The arrival of a first-in-a-lifetime pandemic created a sudden need for average people to find and process large amounts of complicated and rapidly evolving information,0
"Americans turned to many different sources for that information, but two commonly cited ones, the White House and the news media, brought out especially sharp partisan differences in attitudes",0
It was the news Sophie Gryseels had been dreading for months,1
"Almost a year into the pandemic, a seemingly healthy wild mink tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Utah",1
"No free-roaming animal was known to have caught the virus before, although researchers had been watching for this closely",0
"É??ItÉ??s happened,É?ù wrote Gryseels, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Antwerp, Belgium, in an e-mail to her colleagues",1
"Ever since the coronavirus started spreading around the world, scientists have worried that it could leap from people into wild animals",0
"If so, it might lurk in various species, possibly mutate and then resurge in humans even after the pandemic has subsided",0
"WHO today validated the Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, giving countries, funders, 
 procuring agencies and communities the assurance that it meets international standards for safety, efficacy and manufacturing.",1
The vaccine is produced by the Beijing-based pharmaceutical company Sinovac.,1
"É??The world desperately needs multiple COVID-19 vaccines

"É??We urge manufacturers to participate in the COVAX Facility, share their knowhow and data and contribute to bringing the pandemic under control.É?ù",1
WHOÉ??s Emergency Use Listing (EUL) is a prerequisite for COVAX Facility vaccine supply and international procurement.,1
It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines.,0
Healthcare professionals and public health authorities have a central role in discussing vaccination against COVID-19 with their patients.,1
"Vaccines play a critical role in preventing deaths, hospitalisation caused by infectious diseases. Emerging data on effectiveness indicates 
 that licenced COVID-19vaccines are contributing to controlling the spread of the disease.",1
"Until widespread vaccination has been achieved, both 
 vaccinated and unvaccinated people need to be aware of the additional protective behaviours required to control the pandemic locally.",1

 nine straight weeks of decline.",1
"It recorded more than 55,000 lives lost, a 3% increase from the week before.",0
"Cases rose 10% last week
  to nearly 3 million, with the highest numbers recorded in Brazil, India, Indonesia and Britain, WHO said.",1
"The reversal has been attributed
 to low vaccination rates, the relaxation of mask rules and other precautions, and the swift spread of the more-contagious delta variant,
 which WHO said has now been identified in 111 countries and is expected to become globally dominant in the coming months.",1
"Covid-19 in India may be entering some kind of stage of endemicity where there is low or moderate level of transmission going on, Chief 
 Scientist of the World Health Organisation Dr Soumya Swaminathan said.",1
The endemic stage is when a population learns to live with a virus.,1
ItÉ??s very different from the epidemic stage when the virus overwhelms a population.,0
"During his biweekly conference in Geneva, he added that passing the four millionth recorded death worldwide from COVID-19

"Some patients who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have new, recurring, or ongoing
 symptoms and clinical findings four or more weeks after infection, sometimes after initial symptom recovery.",1
"Post-COVID
 conditions can occur in patients who have had varying degrees of illness during acute infection, including those who had
 mild or asymptomatic infections.",1
Medical and research communities are still learning about these post-acute symptoms and clinical findings.,1
"There are lots of unfounded fears about the COVID-19 vaccines floating around, and one of the most pervasive is the idea that
 these new shots aren't really vaccines, but that they will somehow change your genes or insert themselves into the DNA of your cells.",1
"You may see people posting on social media about the vaccines being a kind of gene therapy, and they're partly right, but in the end
 this idea often misses some important details about how the vaccines work.",1
"They can't change your genes, and they don't stay in your
 body for more than a few days.",1
"In recent decades, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has achieved almost sacred status as a bastion of internationalist

"Over the past two decades, the WHO has recreated structures of what can only
 be described as É??colonial controlÉ??.",1
"Now the health priorities of populations at highest need are overridden by the interests of
 those who now control much of WHOÉ??s agenda: wealthy countries, corporations and high net-worth individuals.",1
"A coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine can prevent you from getting COVID-19 or from becoming seriously ill or dying

"This decision was based on the evidence presented to the TAG-VE that Omicron has several mutations that may have an impact on how it behaves, for example, on how easily it spreads or the severity of illness it causes.",1
Here is a summary of what is currently known.,0
"TodayÉ??s actions demonstrate our commitment to public health in proactively fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic,É?ù said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. É??As the pandemic continues to impact the country, science has shown that vaccination continues to be the safest and most effective way to prevent COVID-19, including the most serious consequences of the disease, such as hospitalization and death.",1

"South Africa reacted with outrage to travel bans, first triggered by the United Kingdom (UK), imposed on it in the wake of the news that its genomics surveillance team had detected a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",1
The Network for Genomics Surveillance in South Africa has been monitoring changes in SARS-CoV-2 since the pandemic first broke out.,1
The new variant É?? identified as B.1.1.529 has been declared a variant of concern by the World Health Organisation and assigned the name Omicron.,1
The mutations identified in Omicron provide theoretical concerns that the variant could be slightly more transmissible than the Delta variant and have reduced sensitivity to antibody activity induced by past infection or vaccines compared to how well the antibody neutralises ancestry virus.,1
"On Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, currently circulating in South Africa, as a É??variant of concernÉ??.",1
It also named it Omicron.,1
"The Network for Genomics Surveillance in South Africa (NGS-SA) had identified the variant on Monday. It had detected a group of related SARS-CoV-2 viruses, which belong to a lineage named B.1.1.529.",1
"Early indications are that this variant is possibly even more transmissible than the highly infectious Delta variant, and that current vaccines may be less effective against it.",1
The Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE) is an independent group of experts that periodically monitors and evaluates the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and assesses if specific mutations and combinations of mutations alter the behaviour of the virus.,1
The TAG-VE was convened on 26 November 2021 to assess the SARS-CoV-2 variant: B.1.1.529.,1
"The B.1.1.529 variant was first reported to WHO from South Africa on 24 November 2021. The epidemiological situation in South Africa has been characterized by three distinct peaks in reported cases, the latest of which was predominantly the Delta variant.",1
"In recent weeks, infections have increased steeply, coinciding with the detection of B.1.1.529 variant. The first known confirmed B.1.1.529 infection was from a specimen collected on 9 November 2021.",1

"If we raise our vaccination rate, protect ourselves and others with masking and expanded testing, and identify people who are infected, we can and we will turn the tide on COVID-19.",1
"It will take a lot of hard work, and itÉ??s going to take some time.",0
"Many of us are frustrated with the nearly 80 million Americans who are still not vaccinated, even though the vaccine is safe, effective, and free.",1
"NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced its investigational novel COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate,PAXLOVIDÉ?õ, significantly reduced hospitalization and death, based on an interim analysis of the Phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients) randomized, double-blind study of non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness.",1
"The scheduled interim analysis showed an 89% reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause compared to placebo in patients treated within three days of symptom onset (primary endpoint); 0.8% of patients who received PAXLOVIDÉ?õ were hospitalized through Day 28 following randomization (3/389 hospitalized with no deaths), compared to 7.0% of patients who received placebo and were hospitalized or died (27/385 hospitalized with 7 subsequent deaths).",1
The statistical significance of these results was high (p<0.0001).,1
"Similar reductions in COVID-19-related hospitalization or death were observed in patients treated within five days of symptom onset; 1.0% of patients who received PAXLOVIDÉ?õ were hospitalized through Day 28 following randomization (6/607 hospitalized, with no deaths), compared to 6.7% of patients who received a placebo (41/612 hospitalized with 10 subsequent deaths), with high statistical significance (p<0.0001).",1
"In the overall study population through Day 28, no deaths were reported in patients who received PAXLOVIDÉ?õ as compared to 10 (1.6%) deaths in patients who received placebo.",1
"London: Britain has granted a conditional authorization to Merck's coronavirus antiviral, the first pill shown to successfully treat COVID-19.",1
"It is the first country to OK the treatment, although it was not immediately clear how quickly the pill would be available.",1
The pill was licensed for adults 18 and older who have tested positive for COVID-19 and have at least one risk factor for developing severe disease.,1
"The drug, known as molnupiravir, is intended to be taken twice a day for five days by people at home with mild to moderate COVID-19.",1
Pfizer Inc and Merck & Co Inc have developed experimental antiviral pills that have shown promising efficacy in trials of adults with COVID-19 who are at high risk of serious illness,1
Both drugs also are being studied to see if they can prevent infection in people exposed to the virus.,0
Here is an explanation of the differences in the two pills.,0
Which of the new pills works better?,1
"Trial figures provided by the two companies suggest that Pfizer has the more effective pill, but they have not yet offered full data.",1
Pfizer said on Friday trial results showed that its pill reduced the chance of hospitalization or death by 89% in COVID-19 patients at risk for severe illness given the treatment within three days of the onset of symptoms and by 85% when given within five days of onset.,1
"Virus can keep acquiring mutations that may be more or less detrimental, says G. Padmanaban of BIRAC",1
"In the wake of the emergence of new coronavirus variant Omicron , persons with co-morbidities and the older age group need to be monitored and, in general, the vaccination of children is the next agenda and India should plan for a booster vaccine dose in the second half of 2022, although two-dose vaccination of the target population is still the priority, said Professor G. Padmanaban (IISc, Bengaluru), senior science innovation adviser, Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), Department of Biotechnology, in an interview.",1
"Many countries are experiencing a resurgence of COVID-19, driven predominantly by the delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2.",1
"In response, these countries are considering the administration of a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose to address potential waning immunity over time and reduced effectiveness against the delta variant.",1
We aimed to use the data repositories of Israel's largest health-care organisation to evaluate the effectiveness of a third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine for preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes.,1
Scientists across the world are racing to understand the Omicron variant of Covid-19 that has led to major panic with the World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring it a Variant of Concern.,1
"While the Omicron variant is speculated to be more dangerous than others, it was the Delta variant that wreaked havoc in several parts of the world, including India, earlier this year.",1
"The WHO said it is coordinating with several researchers worldwide to better understand how the new variant will impact the Covid-19 pandemic, with new findings expected within ""days and weeks.""",1
Scientists are closely monitoring whether cases caused by the Omicron variant reported on public databases start to supplant those caused by Delta.,1
Europe once again finds itself in the centre of a resurgence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.,1
Several countries have gone into lockdown to contain the fresh surge of cases.,0
"Daily infections and deaths in the continent are nearly the same as that recorded in November 2020, when Europe was in the middle of its second wave, according to latest projections by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), an independent population health research centre at University of Washington School of Medicine.",1
"What is more worrying is that severe cases have gone up this time, as evident from the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units (ICU) across Europe.",1
"In November 2020, the requirement for ICU beds was between 25,000 and 42,000. This month, the figure is over 100,000.",1
"The UK on Saturday detected two cases of the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron, according to health secretary Sajid Javid.The patients were detected in Chelmsford and Nottingham.",1
"The new variant has also been identified in South Africa, Botswana, Belgium, Hong Kong and Israel.",1

"An experimental antiviral pill developed by Merck & Co (MRK.N) could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalized for those most at risk of contracting severe COVID-19, according to data that experts hailed as a potential breakthrough in how the virus is treated.",1
"If it gets authorization, molnupiravir, which is designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus, would be the first oral antiviral medication for COVID-19.",1
Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics said they plan to seek U.S. emergency use authorization for the pill as soon as possible and to make regulatory applications worldwide.,1
"""An oral antiviral that can impact hospitalization risk to such a degree would be game-changing,"" said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.",1
"Although the majority of COVID-19 vaccines are only approved for use in adults aged 18 years and above, an increasing number of vaccines are now also being authorized for use in children.",1
"Some countries have given emergency use authorization for mRNA vaccines for use in the adolescent age group (aged 12-17 years): BNT162b2 developed by Pfizer, and mRNA 1273 developed by Moderna.",1
"In November 2021, one stringent regulatory authority approved the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 for the use in children aged 5-11.",1
"Trials in children as young as age 3 years were completed for two inactivated vaccines (Sinovac-CoronaVac and BBIBP-CorV) and these products were approved by Chinese authorities for the age indication of 3-17 years; although these vaccine products have received EUL for adults, they have not yet received WHO EUL for children.",1
"Covaxin, an adjuvanted inactivated vaccine developed by Bharat, was approved in India for the age indication of 12-17 years; but not yet received WHO EUL for this age indication.",1
"The Indian regulatory authorities have given approval to ZycovD, a novel DNA vaccine, for ages 12-17 years; however, this vaccine has not yet received WHO EUL.",1
"Several COVID-19 vaccines are undergoing trials in younger age groups (including as young as 6 months of age), but results have not yet been published.",1
